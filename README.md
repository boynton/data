# data
Some utilities for handling data in Go.

- `object.go` - a map that preserves key order during JSON round trip
- `decimal.go` - a wrapper for math/big.Float that marshals to/from JSON
- `timestamp.go` - a wrapper for time.Time that marshals to/from JSON as RFC 3339 text.
- `misc.go` - some miscellaneous helpers
